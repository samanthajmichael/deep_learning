# üè∫ Pottery Classification using Neural Network üè∫

## Project Overview
Multiclass classification of pottery types using a neural network on archaeological ceramic data from the Digital Archaeological Record (tDAR).

## Dependencies
- Python 3.10.12
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Pandas

## Dataset
The data comes from the Digital Archaeological Record's (tDAR) Ceramics: Temporal-Spatial Dataset (1988), which contains archaeological ceramic data from various sites. Through feature selection and encoding processes detailed in `01_EDA.ipynb`, the original dataset was refined to 95 relevant features for classifying 9 distinct pottery types.

Reference:
- tDAR ID: 6039
- DOI: 10.6067/XCV8TD9WNB

## Model Architecture
- Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
- Input Layer: 95 neurons
- Hidden Layer: 64 neurons (ReLU activation)
- Output Layer: 9 neurons (Softmax activation)
- Batch Size: 256

## Key Techniques
- He Weight Initialization
- L2 Regularization
- Early Stopping
- Learning Rate Decay
- Adam Optimizer

## Performance
- Test Accuracy: 99.31%
- Test Loss: 0.0376

## Model Availability
- Model on Hugging Face Hub: [pottery-classifier](https://huggingface.co/samanthajmichael/pottery_classifier)

## Using the Model
```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Load the model from Hugging Face Hub
model = from_pretrained_keras("samanthajmichael/pottery-classifier")

# Prepare your input data (95 features)
# Make sure your input data is preprocessed the same way as during training
input_data = np.array([[...]])  # Shape: (n_samples, 95) where n_samples is the number of predictions you want to make

# Get predictions
predictions = model.predict(input_data)
```
Note: You'll need to install the huggingface_hub package: `pip install huggingface_hub`
